# Ad Skipper

Ad Skipper is a lightweight helper for **YouTube**. When a skippable ad appears, it automatically presses the skip button as soon as it becomes available (typically after about five seconds), then continues running quietly in the background.

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/anar-bastanov/youtube-ad-skipper/releases/latest), or build the app with Android Studio.
2. Install the APK on your device, and enable “Install unknown apps” if prompted.
3. Launch the app and choose "Open Settings".
4. In accessibility settings, locate Ad Skipper and turn it on.
5. Enjoy YouTube as usual. Skippable ads will be dismissed automatically.

> [!WARNING]
> On Android 13 and newer, Google blocks Accessibility for apps installed outside the Play Store. If you see **“App was denied access | Controlled by Restricted Setting”**, follow these steps:
>
> 1. Open `Settings > Apps > Ad Skipper`.
> 2. Tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner.
> 3. Select "Allow restricted settings".
> 4. If you don’t see this option:
>    * Enable "Developer options": go to `Settings > About phone` and tap “Build number” seven times.
>    * Enter your PIN, then repeat the steps above
> 
> If the option still doesn’t appear, try opening Ad Skipper once, then check the app settings again. On some phones, you may need to reinstall the app after enabling Developer options. Menu names and locations can vary by manufacturer.
>
> After this one-time setup, Ad Skipper will work normally in the background.
