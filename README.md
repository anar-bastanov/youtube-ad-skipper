# Ad Skipper

Ad Skipper is a lightweight helper for **YouTube**. When a skippable ad appears, it automatically presses the skip button as soon as it becomes available (typically after about five seconds), then continues running quietly in the background.

## Installation

1. **Download** the latest APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/anar-bastanov/youtube-ad-skipper/releases/latest), or build the app with Android Studio.
2. **Install** the APK on your device, and enable “Install unknown apps” if prompted.
3. **Enable** the service:
    * Launch the app and choose "Open Settings".
    * In accessibility settings, locate Ad Skipper and turn it on.
4. **Use** YouTube as usual. Skippable ads will be dismissed automatically.
